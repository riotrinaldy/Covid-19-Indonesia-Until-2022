### 📌 Data Foundation

* *Information Source:* Official Indonesian government health records and verified public datasets (2020–2022)
* *Coverage Period:* March 2020 through September 2022
* *Key Metrics Analyzed:*
  * Total confirmed infections
  * Death counts and mortality rates
  * Recovery numbers
  * Daily new case trends
  * Provincial-level breakdowns

### 📊 Major Findings

* *National Impact:* *6,397,309 confirmed cases* with *157,819 deaths* and *6,204,553 recoveries*
* *Mortality Rate:* *3.20%* overall death rate across the pandemic period
* *Peak Periods:* Major surges occurred in *July 2021* and *March 2022, with daily new cases exceeding **50,000*, corresponding to the Delta and Omicron variant waves

#### 🗺 Regional Impact Analysis:

* *Highest Case Numbers:*
  * DKI Jakarta: 1,412,474 cases
  * West Java: 1,173,731 cases  
  * Central Java: 636,409 cases

* *Highest Fatality Counts:*
